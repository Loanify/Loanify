* We then made our slack and trello board.
* Added the user stories to trello.
* Then came wire framing.
* Then we tackled the schemas for our three models.
* Following that we researched node mailer and tried to understand
  how we would email students.
* Then we delegated work and progressed thru user stories.
* We then celebrated.

##Aproach
The weekend prior to project week we delegated tasks and tackled the project in pieces.
Then we decided Monday on how we would approach Github, who managed Github, and the
overal approach we would take to merge our branches into master origin. Why? Because
that same day we hit our first merge conflict.

The rest of the week was spent tackling features and splitting up work amongst eachother.
We got close to mvp on Wednesday, but ultimately reached mvp the next day. Whenever we hit a problem or merge conflict, we handled it immediately. Finally, we managed to stay together as a team and take care of the user stories, ultimately creating an app that we feel answered the problems each user story needed resolved.
